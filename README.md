# Standup Shuffler
## Competition to create the ultimate queuing tool
- Deployed: https://standupshuffler.netlify.app/

### Goal
- Create a small, visually appealing application with the tech of your choice that will shuffle through our squad members and create a speaking queue. 
- It can be a single randomly generated list or an interactive tool that cycles through each member one at a time.
- Consider how we will need to integrate it into our standups and how we might want to make changes to the speaker lists in the future. 
- We will go through each application as they are finished and vote on the best one to become an official tool for our standups.
- Get creative with it!

### Instructions
- Create your project in a new repo and then add an entry to [this Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M9IfYcLvBnBilfIAnkj0p_OiVk7aYQP1_cawptkw188/edit#gid=0) when you are ready to submit. I will check it each morning.

### Requirements
- The list of IMs and ICs must come before the list of Developers, Content, and QA (See example in _src folder). 
- Never repeat a squad member's name.
- The list(s) must be unique each time the application is run.
- Provide a README for your repo with a little description of your project.
